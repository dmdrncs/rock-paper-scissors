# Rock Paper Scissors

## About Project
This project is based on the "grade-school" game rock-paper-scissors.

It's a single-player game against the computer. I built this game to help improve my skills as a developer. 

With this project I am learning Javascript: functions and loops and interactivity between user and computer.


## Future Goal
My goal is to maybe come back and change the game into the famous Big Bang Thoery game of rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock. That could be fun.
